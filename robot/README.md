So, this bot is a basic obstacle avoidance bot.  It's built using an Arduino Uno, and the Make:it Robotics starter kit PCB board (Motor sheild), chassis from the same kit, a Parallax PING))) sensor, and lastly a EMAX ES08A servo (http://www.servodatabase.com/servo/emax/es08a ).

The code is pretty self documented, as far as which pins to use for the servo and sensor.  The servo is mounted on the front of the chassis, with the Parallax sensor mounted on top of it.

Also, left, center, and right are constants, since not all servos are created equal.  These values worked for me, but YMMV.
